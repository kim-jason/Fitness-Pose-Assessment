# Fitness-Pose-Assessment
Use of MediaPipe library (https://mediapipe.dev/) on live and recorded video.

Updated the original library to assess a person's fitness squat pose accuracy in real-time by calculating the angles of knees and locations of feet. Updated the program to be able to utilize the ML model on recorded video files to assess pose accuracy.
